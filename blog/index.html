		September 9, 2025<br>
		New website! I don&apos;t like the <a target="blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/2/http://discoanddj.com/">old website.</a> Even though nobody used it except
		for my old friend, I don&apos;t like image board culture. It&apos;s not appropriate for disco and dj because nobody even knows what disco and dj is so why would
		they want to post on an image board made for it. And if they DID know what disco and dj was, there would be nothing to post except for some same regurgitated joke
		because thats what every imageboard becomes. I do not want a community that jerks eachother&apos;s dicks or jerks my dick just so that when they make some 
		disco and dj related joke or content they too can get their dick jerked. This kind of disco and dj community does infact not exist, but that is what the old website
		felt like it was trying to create. I haven&apos;t made anything in a long time, but I always DID enjoy making things. I won&apos;t make things for any aproval or 
		recognition, I will make what I&apos;ve been wanting to make for a long time, only because I want to make it. Hopefully YOU will apriciate it.
